### Examples of the type of thing wanted

Each 'object' will have it's own rarity, which I need an indicator of at some point. However, each object, regardless of their rarity, can ALSO be a 'shiny rare' which is a lot harder to get than a normal one. As such, this needs a distinct difference in appearance, hence the holo-foil idea.

Here are some links to some examples I could find:
