## Shine PoC

The object is for a user to be able to upload ANY image/object file, be loaded into threejs (or other 3D rendering library that can be used to display on webpages), and a shine/sparkle filter applied to it.

There could be upwards of 10-20 of these showing on a single page, so the shine/sparkle effect needs to be not _horribly_ computer intensive.

## Setup

npm install

npm run dev


### Examples of the type of thing wanted

Each 'object' will have it's own rarity, which I need an indicator of at some point. However, each object, regardless of their rarity, can ALSO be a 'shiny rare' which is a lot harder to get than a normal one. As such, this needs a distinct difference in appearance, hence the holo-foil idea.

Here are some links to some examples I could find:
